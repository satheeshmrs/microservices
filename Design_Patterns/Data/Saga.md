# Saga Pattern (Distributed Transactions)

## 1. The Problem
- In monoliths, a single database transaction can span multiple tables ‚Üí ACID guarantees.  
- In microservices, each service has its own database (**Database per Service**).  
- A single business process (e.g., placing an order) may touch multiple services/databases.  
- Global transactions across services are hard due to:
  - Different DB technologies.  
  - Network failures.  
  - Scalability concerns.  

üëâ The **Saga Pattern** solves this.

---

## 2. What is the Saga Pattern?
A **Saga** is a **sequence of local transactions** across services.  
- Each local transaction updates its own database and then publishes an **event**.  
- The next service listens for that event and executes its own local transaction.  
- If one transaction fails ‚Üí the saga triggers **compensating transactions** to undo previous changes.  

üëâ Guarantees **eventual consistency** instead of strong ACID.

## 3. Saga Execution Models

### 1. Choreography (Event-driven)
- Each service listens to events and reacts.  
- No central coordinator.  

**Example:**  
1. `Order Service` ‚Üí creates order, emits `OrderCreated`.  
2. `Payment Service` ‚Üí processes payment, emits `PaymentProcessed`.  
3. `Inventory Service` ‚Üí reserves stock, emits `StockReserved`.  
4. `Shipping Service` ‚Üí ships item.  

If payment fails ‚Üí `Order Service` receives `PaymentFailed` and cancels order.  

‚úÖ Simple, decentralized  
‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to manage/debug complex flows  

### 2. Orchestration (Coordinator)
- A central **Saga Orchestrator** coordinates the workflow.  
- Orchestrator tells each service what to do next.  

**Example:**  
1. Orchestrator ‚Üí tells `Payment Service` to process payment.  
2. If success ‚Üí tells `Inventory Service` to reserve stock.  
3. If success ‚Üí tells `Shipping Service` to ship.  
4. If failure ‚Üí orchestrator issues compensating actions.  

‚úÖ Centralized control, easier to manage  
‚ö†Ô∏è Orchestrator can become a bottleneck

## 4. Example ‚Äì E-commerce Order

### Choreography Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Customer
  participant O as Order Service
  participant P as Payment Service
  participant I as Inventory Service
  participant S as Shipping Service

  C->>O: Place Order
  O->>P: OrderCreated Event
  P->>O: PaymentSucceeded Event
  P->>I: PaymentSucceeded Event
  I->>S: StockReserved Event
  S->>C: Order Shipped
```

### Orchestration Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Customer
  participant O as Orchestrator
  participant P as Payment Service
  participant I as Inventory Service
  participant S as Shipping Service

  C->>O: Place Order
  O->>P: Process Payment
  P->>O: Payment Result
  O->>I: Reserve Stock
  I->>O: Inventory Result
  O->>S: Ship Order
  S->>O: Shipping Result
  O->>C: Order Completed
```

## 5. Benefits
- ‚úÖ Works across different services/databases.  
- ‚úÖ No need for distributed ACID transactions.  
- ‚úÖ Enables **eventual consistency**.  
- ‚úÖ Resilient ‚Äì supports compensation/rollback.  

---

## 6. Challenges
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex than traditional transactions.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires careful design of compensating actions.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Debugging sagas can be difficult.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Eventual consistency may not suit all use cases.  

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **Saga Pattern** = distributed transaction solution for microservices.  
- Two styles: **Choreography (event-driven)** or **Orchestration (coordinator)**.  
- Ensures **eventual consistency** with **compensating transactions**.  
- Ideal for **e-commerce orders, IoT workflows, booking systems**.
